Dear !!!!! LANDLORD NAME !!!!!,

I just saw your listing for this apartment ({{ href }}) on Craigslist and it looks gorgeous! Is it still available??

My boyfriend and I are moving to San Francisco this week, both of us starting jobs as software engineers. We're looking for a nice 1 or 2br apartment close to public transportation (especially CalTrain), and this apartment looks just perfect.

Please let me know if you are still looking for interested tenants and I would be very happy to see the place/submit an application. We are both able to bring proof of employment and any other materials (credit reports, references, etc.). We could stop by anytime on or after July 8th.

Thank you!

!!!!! YOUR NAME !!!!!!
