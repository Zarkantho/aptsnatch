Hello,

I found your listing for this apartment %(href)s and it looks like just what I'm looking for!  Is it still available?  I just started a new job in DC, and I'm looking for a permanent apartment near %(query)s, which is near where I work.

Please let me know if you are still looking for interested tenants and I would be very happy to see the place/submit an application. I'm able to bring proof of employment and any other materials (credit reports, references, etc.).  I'm available tomorrow after 6pm, this weekend, or next week after 6pm most weekdays.

Thank you, and hope to hear from you soon!

!!!!! YOUR NAME !!!!!!
